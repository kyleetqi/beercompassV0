# Beer Compass

A compass that always points you to the nearest beer store using the Arduino framework, developed on Platform IO. This code is written for the debug/development version of the project, which uses breadboarding and breakout boards. A second generation version of this project is also under development that harmonizes the electronics on a custom PCB.
